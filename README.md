# My Journey

I will use the repository to document my journey as a software developer.

I am current at this moment, learning GraphQL; and I will be documenting my journey in the GraphQL page.

The nice thing about Github is that you have the option of working on your repositories from Github's web-based interface or from your own system of choice (Linux, Windows, Mac, etc).

### Vim

What's a side effect of using Vim?  You start typing Vim commands when using other text editors, without even thinking about it. :D

### My Objective

To become a well-rounded engineer that not only understands software development, but also hardware engineering.
